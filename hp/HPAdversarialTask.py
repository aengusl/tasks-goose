HARRY_POTTER_SUMMARY_LONG = """"Harry Potter" is a globally acclaimed series of seven fantasy novels authored by J.K. Rowling. The saga commences with "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone" (released as "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" in the U.S.) and concludes with "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows." The narrative centers on Harry Potter, an orphaned boy who discovers on his eleventh birthday that he is a wizard. He is whisked away from his mundane life to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Throughout the series, Harry grapples with his past, specifically the death of his parents and his unwanted fame as the sole survivor of the killing curse cast by the malevolent Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard intent on conquering the wizarding world.

The series intricately weaves the lives of several characters around Harry, notably his close friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, and a diverse cast of students, teachers, and magical creatures. Central to the plot is Harry's struggle against Lord Voldemort, who seeks to destroy all who stand in his way, particularly Harry, due to a prophecy that links their fates. Each book chronicles a year of Harry's life and adventures, marked by distinct challenges and battles. Key elements include the exploration of Harry's legacy as the "Boy Who Lived," the significance of his friends and mentors like Dumbledore, and the internal struggles and growth of various characters. The series delves into complex themes such as the nature of good and evil, the dynamics of power and corruption, and the value of friendship and loyalty.

Beyond the immediate struggle between Harry and Voldemort, the series is acclaimed for its rich, expansive universe, encompassing a detailed magical society with its own history, culture, and politics. Themes of prejudice, social inequality, and the battle for social justice are prominent, especially in the portrayal of non-magical beings ("Muggles"), half-bloods, and magical creatures. The narrative also emphasizes the importance of choices and personal growth, showcasing the development of its characters from children into young adults facing a complex world. The Harry Potter series has not only achieved immense popularity but also sparked discussions on wider social and educational themes, leaving a lasting impact on contemporary culture and literature."""
